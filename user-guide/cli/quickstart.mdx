In this guide you'll install and learn how to use the `cf` CLI to request access to entitlements.

## Installing

We release precompiled binaries of the Common Fate CLI for MacOS, Linux and Windows. The CLI itself is [open-sourced here](https://github.com/common-fate/cli). Choose instructions corresponding to your operating system below.

<Tab title="MacOS">

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open source package manager for MacOS. We publish a Homebrew formula for the Common Fate CLI. To install the CLI with Homebrew, run the command below in your terminal.

```
brew install common-fate/tap/cf
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Linux">

Select the steps which match your system architecture. You can find your architecture by running `uname -m` from a terminal window.

sudo tar -zxvf ./cf_1.10.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

<Tab title="Windows">

First, download the zip archive of the Common Fate CLI which matches your system's architecture. You can find your architecture by viewing your system properties in the Control Panel.

[cf for Windows x86_64](https://releases.commonfate.io/cf/v1.10.0/cf_1.10.0_windows_x86_64.zip)

[cf for Windows arm64](https://releases.commonfate.io/cf/v1.10.0/cf_1.10.0_windows_arm64.zip)

[cf for Windows i386](https://releases.commonfate.io/cf/v1.10.0/cf_1.10.0_windows_i386.zip)

After downloading the CLI, unzip the package.

You'll need to move `cf` to a folder that is accessible on your `PATH`. [This StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) has instructions on how to do this.

If you are using `cf` with the [Git Bash shell on Windows](https://gitforwindows.org), we recommend enabling experimental support for pseudo consoles. You may need to reinstall Git For Windows to enable this. You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/404).

## Verify the installation

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of the binary you have downloaded by running through the [verification process here](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/security#release-verification). We use the same GPG keys to sign the Common Fate binary as we do for the Granted CLI shown in the linked documentation.

## First-time CLI setup

To configure the CLI to communicate with your Common Fate deployment, run:

```
cf
```

The first time you run the CLI you'll be prompted for your deployment URL. This is the URL that you access your web dashboard through, such as `https://commonfate.example.com`. After you've entered your dashboard, the CLI will attempt to log you in.

The CLI will also set up a TOML configuration file in `~/.cf/config` containing the OIDC authentication information associated with your deployment. This file will look something like this:

```toml
current_context = "default"

[context]
  [context.default]
    api_url = "https://commonfate.example.com"
    oidc_issuer = "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_012345abcdef"
    oidc_client_id = "3128763128763asvbadkjasd"
```

To discover the available commands in the CLI, you can run:

```
cf --help
```

You can now use the CLI to request access to entitlements. You can list the available entitlements with:

```
cf access list available
```

And request access with:

```
cf access ensure --target <target> --role <role>
```
