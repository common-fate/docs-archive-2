description: "Request Access using Common Fate"
---

You can request access using the CLI or the web application. There is a notable change in the Grant lifecycle compared to our open-source framework. Previously, in Glide, approved requests would be activated immediately. However, in asynchronous working environments, this posed challenges. For instance, if you requested access for a specific timeframe and the account owner was in a different timezone, you might miss the window of access.

Common Fate introduces a separate activation step after approval by the requestor. The following is the requesting access flow:

## Granted Integration (CLI)

### Common Fate built-in Profile Registry

Granted connects with Common Fate to automatically sync available AWS profiles into your **`~/.aws/config`** file. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/usage/profile-registry#common-fate-built-in-profile-registry) to set this up.

### Request Access using Granted

[Granted](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/introduction) integrates with Common Fate allowing users to request access from the CLI. Please follow [this guide](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/recipes/access-requests) to set this up.

### List Available Roles

You can list the available entitlements with:

```bash
cf access list available
```

### Request Access

You can request access to entitlements with:

```bash
cf access ensure --target AWS::Account::00123456789 --role AWSAdministratorAccess
```

Multiple `--target` and `--role` pairs can be specified to request access to multiple entitlements at once. If one entitlement needs approval and another is auto-approved, you'll receive two Access Requests back. For example:

```bash
cf access ensure --target AWS::Account::00123456789 --role AWSAdministratorAccess --target GCP::Project::develop-123 --role Editor
```

<Note>
  In versions >=v3.9.0 the requested target and role will be added automatically
  to your `~/.aws/config` file. To disable this function when requesting access
  include the `--skip-local-config-update` flag
</Note>

### Approve Request

Approve a pending access request:

```bash
cf access approve request --id req_2bK5UuJ9po73tgGmVRFPQGCA6vE
```

### Activate Request

Re-run `cf access ensure` to activate access request:

```bash
cf access ensure --target GCP::Project::develop-123 --role Editor
```

The CLI indicates that access will be activated now. The user presses “Y” to confirm. Based on this, here are the meanings of the different states:

- **GRANT_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED**: This represents the GRPC unspecified value for the enum. It should never be returned under normal operations.
- **GRANT_STATUS_PROVISIONING**: Access is currently being provisioned.
- **GRANT_STATUS_PENDING**: A grant exists, but it’s not yet active. If you encounter GRANT_STATUS_PENDING after running `cf access ensure`, manual review is required. Our CLI prints the request URL to stderr when run with the default output settings in this case.
- **GRANT_STATUS_ACTIVE**: Access grant is active. If you see this status, you currently have access.
- **GRANT_STATUS_CLOSED**: This indicates a grant that is no longer active.

### Close Request

Close a request that is no longer needed by:

```bash
cf access close request --id req_2bK5UuJ9po73tgGmVRFPQGCA6vE
```

### List Requests

List all access requests in your deployment with their details:

```bash
cf access list requests
```

For JSON output, use the `--output json` flag with respective commands.
