## Introduction

In order to use Common Fate to grant least-privileged access to your entitlements, you'll need to set up integrations and policies.

To avoid confusion, we make a distinction between Application Configuration and Infrastructure Configuration:

| Type                         | Description                                                                      | Examples                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application Configuration    | Configuration of Common Fate itself                                              | Setting up access policies which defines which entitlements are available to request |
| Infrastructure Configuration | Configuration of the infrastructure to create your Common Fate deployment in AWS | Configuration of the VPC that your Common Fate application runs inside of            |

Common Fate uses Terraform to manage all application-level configuration. To avoid any dependency issues between the infrastructure and application layers we recommend using a separate Terraform root module for your Application Configuration.

Without configuring resources and plugins into Common Fate, the deployment is a bit of an empty shell. It is an integral part of the set up to have some configuration set for your deployment.

All Application Configuration is created and managed using the [`commonfate` Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/common-fate/commonfate/latest). Refer to [our provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/common-fate/commonfate/latest/docs) for detailed guidance on the available Terraform resources.
