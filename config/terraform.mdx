title: "Setup Common Fate Terraform Provider"
description: "This guide outlines the steps for configuring the Common Fate Terraform provider."
---

## **Prerequisites**

- Terraform installed and configured.
- An active Common Fate deployment and access to the deployment Terraform code.

## Folder Structure

We recommend creating a different folder for setting up the configuration and for each integration. We have an example for AWS here: [https://github.com/common-fate/byoc-aws-starter-config](https://github.com/common-fate/byoc-aws-starter-config)

```
├── aws-integration
   └── main.tf
├── config
   ├── main.tf
   └── aws_idc.tf
└── deployment
    └── main.tf
```

## Requirements

This guide will walk you through setting up the `commonfate` Terraform provider. This guide will be only for getting the provider configured with your Common Fate deployment.

For more information about each of the different resources these are documented on the provider registry page: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/common-fate/commonfate/latest/docs

The provider requires some variables for it to work with your deployment. All of these variables can be found from your deployment Terraforms outputs.

Our Terraform provider uses a machine-to-machine OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol to authenticate to Common Fate. The AWS Cognito user pool deployed with Common Fate acts as the OIDC issuer.

<Note>
  We're considering adding support for additional OIDC provider authentication,
  such as GitHub Actions and Spacelift. Let your Common Fate account manager
  know if you'd like to see this implemented.
</Note>

Here's an example of a configured `provider` block:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    commonfate = {
      source  = "common-fate/commonfate"
      version = "2.13.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "commonfate" {
  api_url            = "http://commonfate.example.com"
  oidc_client_id     = "349dfdfkljwerpoizxckf3fds345xcvv" # terraform_client_id from deployment/main.tf's terraform output
  oidc_issuer        = "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_jieDxjtS" # auth_issuer from deployment/main.tf's terraform output
}
```

You'll also need to set the `CF_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable in the environment that your Terraform is running in. If you're using a CI/CD runner like GitHub Actions we recommend storing this as a secret and injecting this when the Terraform plan/apply runs. To get the value of `CF_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, you need to run `terraform output terraform_client_secret` in deployment/main.tf.

## Configuring the Terraform Provider using environment variables

You can optionally configure the `commonfate` Terraform Provider using environment variables. When using environment variables for configuration, leave the provider block empty:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    commonfate = {
      source  = "common-fate/commonfate"
      version = "2.13.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "commonfate" {}
```

Then, set the specified variables when running `terraform` commands:

```bash
export CF_API_URL=http://commonfate.example.com
export CF_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=349dfdfkljwerpoizxckf3fds345xcvv # terraform_client_id from deployment/main.tf's terraform output
export CF_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXX # terraform_client_secret from deployment/main.tf's terraform output
export CF_OIDC_ISSUER=https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_jieDxjtS # auth_issuer from deployment/main.tf's terraform output

terraform plan
```

## Finding deployment outputs

<Note>
  You will need to make sure you have the following outputs in your deployment
  Terraform code. If you used one of our boilerplate Terraform examples these
  should be included
</Note>

<Accordion title="Example outputs">
```hcl outputs.tf
output "outputs" {
  description = "outputs"
  value       = module.common-fate-deployment.outputs
}

output "terraform_client_secret" {
description = "terraform client secret"
value = module.common-fate-deployment.terraform_client_secret
sensitive = true
}

```
</Accordion>

To get the values you need for each of the provider variables you will need to get the outputs from the deployment Terraform.

This can be done by running the following in the root of the Terraform files:

Make sure you have AWS credentials for the account your Common Fate is deployed to
```

assume <role_to_access_deployment> -r <region_of_deployment>

```
Run the output command to get a list of outputs.
```

terraform output -json

```

You should see an output like this:
```

"app_url": {
"sensitive": false,
"type": "string",
"value": ""
},
"auth_url": {
"sensitive": false,
"type": "string",
"value": ""
},
"oidc_issuer": {
"sensitive": false,
"type": "string",
"value": ""
},
...

````

The variables we need are:
- app_url
- oidc_issuer
- terraform_client_id
- terraform_client_secret

Use these variables in place like this:

```hcl

provider "commonfate" {
  api_url = <app_url>
  oidc_client_id = <terraform_client_id>
  oidc_client_secret = <terraform_client_secret>
  oidc_issuer = <oidc_issuer>
}

````

# Read-Only Client Credentials

You may also wish to use the read-only credentials for some workflows, these have access to read policies and configuration, but cannot make any changes to your infrastructure.

The variables we need are:

- read_only_client_id
- read_only_client_secret

Use these variables in place like this:

```hcl

provider "commonfate" {
  api_url = <app_url>
  oidc_client_id = <read_only_client_id>
  oidc_client_secret = <read_only_client_secret>
  oidc_issuer = <oidc_issuer>
}

```
