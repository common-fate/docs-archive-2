## What are Availabilities?

Availabilities are used in Common Fate to inform the policy engine what **role** to be attached to a set of resources identified by a selector. Avilabilities reference a [Selector](/config/selectors) which determines which targets should be available for what role.

## Creating an Availability

There are availabilities for each of the supported resources in Common Fate.

Below is an example of a GCP Availability:

```hcl workflow.tf
resource "commonfate_gcp_project_availabilities" "availability-demo" {
  workflow_id = commonfate_access_workflow.workflow-demo.id
  gcp_role = "roles/owner"
  gcp_project_selector_id = commonfate_gcp_project_selector.selector-demo.id
  google_workspace_customer_id = commonfate_gcp_project_integration.main.google_workspace_customer_id
  role_priority = 1
}
```

This Availability tells Common Fate to handle any project resource selected by selector "sel_123" to be accessed with the "roles/owner" with the access workflow "wrk_123".

This is the configuration aspect of access completed. The next component is creating the rules of who can access what resources based on actions. For this we use [Cedar Policies](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en)

The `role_priority` field can be used customize which role is suggested to end users in the UI. Consider the following scenerio:
```hcl workflow.tf
resource "commonfate_gcp_project_availabilities" "availability-demo" {
  workflow_id = commonfate_access_workflow.workflow-demo.id
  gcp_role = "roles/owner"
  gcp_project_selector_id = commonfate_gcp_project_selector.selector-demo.id
  google_workspace_customer_id = commonfate_gcp_project_integration.main.google_workspace_customer_id
  role_priority = 1
}
resource "commonfate_gcp_project_availabilities" "availability-demo" {
  workflow_id = commonfate_access_workflow.workflow-demo.id
  gcp_role = "roles/viewer"
  gcp_project_selector_id = commonfate_gcp_project_selector.selector-demo.id
  google_workspace_customer_id = commonfate_gcp_project_integration.main.google_workspace_customer_id
  role_priority = 2
}
```

When availabilities are created from these availability specs, `roles/viewer` will be used as the suggested role for availability made by these availability specs.
