## What are Access Workflows?

Workflows are used in Common Fate to inform the policy engine **how long** access should last. Workflows connect with other resources like availabilities and Slack alerts.

## Creating an Access Workflow

Access workflows are created using the `commonfate_access_workflow` resource in Terraform.

```hcl workflow.tf
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
}
```

<Info>
Changing the access duration on a Workflow does not affect the duration of any existing Access Requests.

For example, if you have an Access Workflow with a 2 hour access duration, create an Access Request, and then reduce the duration of the Access Workflow to 1 hour, the existing Access Request will still have a 2 hour duration.

</Info>

The `priority` governs whether the policy will be used. If a different policy with a higher priority and the same role exists that one will be used over another.

## Specifying an activation expiry

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v1.41.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.16 or
  later.
</Note>

Common Fate can be configured to automatically close approved requests if they are not activated within a particular duration. To configure an activation expiry, set the `activation_expiry` variable in the Access Workflow:

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
+ activation_expiry        = 60 * 60 * 8
}
```

The `activation_expiry` cause requests to expire if they are approved but not activated for a specified amount of time.

In the example above any requests approved but not activated after 8 hours will be closed, requiring the user to re-request access.

## Requiring a reason on Access Requests

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v1.42.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.17 or
  later.
</Note>

To require a reason on Access Requests for a particular workflow, you can specify the `validation` variable on the Access Workflow:

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
+ validation = {
+   has_reason = true
+ }
}
```

## Validating the reason on Access Requests

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v4.10.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.25.3
  or later.
</Note>

To require add validation to the reason on Access Requests for a particular workflow, you can specify the `validation` variable on the Access Workflow:

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
  + validation = {
  +   regex = [{
  +       regex_pattern = "/.{20}/",
  +       error_message = "Reason must be at least 20 characters long",
  +     },
  +     {
  +       regex_pattern = "/CF-\\d+/"
  +       error_message = "Please include a ticket ID (CF-XXX)"
  +     },
  +
  +   ]
  + }
}
```

Make sure to double escape any backslash characters by using \. In the example above, the regex \d+ needs to be escaped like \\d+ so that terraform is able to read the string.

## Specifying a default duration for Access Requests

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v1.42.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.17 or
  later.
</Note>

The Common Fate web console and CLI will default to the maximum duration when requesting access. You can change the default duration by providing the `default_duration_seconds` variable on the Access Workflow:

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
+ default_duration_seconds = 30 * 60
  priority                 = 100
}
```

## Enabling Access Request Extensions

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v4.4.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.22.0
  or later.
</Note>

By default, the Common Fate web console will not allow extensions if the `extension_conditions` configuration is not specified on the Access Workflow.

<Note>
  A cedar policy also needs to be defined to allow the
  Access::Action::"Extension" action on the resource.
</Note>

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
+ extension_conditions = {
+   maximum_number_of_extensions = 2
+   extension_duration_seconds = 10 * 60
+ }
}
```

The `maximum_number_of_extensions` parameter sets the number of times an Access Request can be extended. This can be set to 0, effectively disabling extensions.

The `extension_duration_seconds` parameter defines the duration, in seconds, that the Access Request will be extended by.

Extensions can only be requested after at least 50% of the duration has elapsed. This ensures that extensions are used judiciously and not immediately after access is granted.

For example, with an initial access duration of 60 minutes:

1. You must wait at least 30 minutes (50% of the initial duration) before requesting your first extension.
2. If you extend when you have 25 minutes remaining, your access will be extended to 35 minutes.
3. You can request a second extension after another 5 minutes (50% of the extension duration) has elapsed.
4. With a maximum of two extensions, you can add up to 20 minutes to your initial access duration.

This approach ensures that extensions are used thoughtfully and only when necessary.
