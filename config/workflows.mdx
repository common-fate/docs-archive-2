## What are Access Workflows?

Workflows are used in Common Fate to inform the policy engine **how long** access should last. Workflows connect with other resources like availabilities and Slack alerts.

## Creating an Access Workflow

Access workflows are created using the `commonfate_access_workflow` resource in Terraform.

```hcl workflow.tf
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
}
```

<Info>
Changing the access duration on a Workflow does not affect the duration of any existing Access Requests.

For example, if you have an Access Workflow with a 2 hour access duration, create an Access Request, and then reduce the duration of the Access Workflow to 1 hour, the existing Access Request will still have a 2 hour duration.

</Info>

The `priority` governs whether the policy will be used. If a different policy with a higher priority and the same role exists that one will be used over another.

## Specifying an activation expiry

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v1.41.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.16 or
  later.
</Note>

Common Fate can be configured to automatically close approved requests if they are not activated within a particular duration. To configure an activation expiry, set the `activation_expiry` variable in the Access Workflow:

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
+ activation_expiry        = 60 * 60 * 8
}
```

The `activation_expiry` cause requests to expire if they are approved but not activated for a specified amount of time.

In the example above any requests approved but not activated after 8 hours will be closed, requiring the user to re-request access.

## Requiring a reason on Access Requests

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v1.42.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.17 or
  later.
</Note>

To require a reason on Access Requests for a particular workflow, you can specify the `validation` variable on the Access Workflow:

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
+ validation = {
+   has_reason = true
+ }
}
```

## Specifying a default duration for Access Requests

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v1.42.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.17 or
  later.
</Note>

The Common Fate web console and CLI will default to the maximum duration when requesting access. You can change the default duration by providing the `default_duration_seconds` variable on the Access Workflow:

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
+ default_duration_seconds = 30 * 60
  priority                 = 100
}
```

## Enabling Access Request Extensions

<Note>
  Added in Common Fate v1.42.0. Requires Common Fate Terraform Provider v2.17 or
  later.
</Note>

By default, the Common Fate web console will not allow extensions, if the `extension_conditions` configuration is not specified on the Access Workflow.

```diff
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = 100
+ extension_conditions = {
+   maximum_number_of_extensions = 2
+   extension_duration_seconds = 10 * 60
+ }
}
```

The `maximum_number_of_extensions` parameter sets the number of times an Access Request can be extended. If not set, it defaults to zero, effectively disabling extensions.

The `extension_duration_seconds` parameter defines the duration, in seconds, that the Access Request will be extended by. If not specified, it defaults to the same duration as the access_duration_seconds. In the example above, if extension_duration_seconds is not specified, it will default to 60 \* 60 (the same as access_duration_seconds).

Using the configuration above, if you have 35 minutes remaining on your Access Request, you can extend the duration by 10 minutes. This will increase the remaining time to 45 minutes. You can extend the access up to two times, meaning you can add a total of 20 minutes to your initial access duration.
