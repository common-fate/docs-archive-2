Common Fate uses [authorization policy-as-code](/authz/introduction) powered by [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/). In this guide, you'll learn how to validate Cedar policies to catch issues before they are deployed.

## Prerequisites

If you're running a BYOC ("Bring-Your-Own-Cloud") deployment of Common Fate in your own AWS account, you'll need to be on `v1.31.0` or later of the `common-fate/common-fate-deployment/aws` Terraform module.

You'll also need the [Common Fate `cf` CLI installed](/user-guide/cli/quickstart) - v1.12.0 or higher. You can check this by running `cf --version`. You should see an output similar to the below

```bash
cf --version
cf version v1.12.0
# version must be v1.12.0 or higher for this guide.
```

## Validating Cedar policies using the CLI

Validating policies is a [linting](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/latest/01b-Linting-Code) step which helps you catch issues quickly during policy development. Validation helps prevent issues like referencing a nonexistent action or a resource attribute in Cedar policies, or simply making a typo in a policy.

To get started, let's create a sample invalid policy. Create a new folder for our policy testing:

```bash
mkdir common-fate-policy-testing
cd common-fate-policy-testing
```

Inside this folder, we'll create a file called `example.cedar`. This file will contain an invalid Cedar policy:

```cedar example.cedar
permit (
    principal,
    action == Action::"Invalid",
    resource
);
```

The policy above is invalid because `Action::"Invalid"` does not correspond to any possible actions within Common Fate.

To validate the policy, run:

```bash
cf authz policyset validate
```

You should see an output similar to below, showing that validation has failed:

```
validating 1 policies
example.cedar ... FAILED

issues:

---- example.cedar ----

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0`: unrecognized action `Action::"Invalid"`

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0`: unable to find an applicable action given the policy head constraints

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0`: policy is impossible: the policy expression evaluates to false for all valid requests
```

Let's fix the policy. Replace the contents of `example.cedar` with:

```cedar example.cedar
permit (
    principal,
    action == Access::Action::"Request",
    resource
);
```

Now validate the policy again, by running:

```
cf authz policyset validate
```

You should see an output similar to the below, showing that validation has succeeded:

```
validating 1 policies
example.cedar ... ok
```

## Retrieving the Cedar schema

How does Common Fate know which actions are valid, and which aren't? Common Fate checks the policies against a [Cedar schema](https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/schema/schema.html). The schema contains type definitions for all principals, actions, and resources used in Common Fate.

To see all of these type definitions, you can download the Cedar schema in [JSON format](https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/schema/json-schema.html):

```
cf authz schema get
```

You should see a JSON output similar to the below:

```json
{
  "AWS": {
    "entityTypes": {
      "Account": {
        "shape": {
          "type": "Record",
          "attributes": {
            "name": {
              "type": "String"
            },
... (the rest of the output omitted for brevity)
```

## Fixing common validation issues

The following actions may require you to specify a **Grant** resource type, such as `AWS::IDC::AccountGrant` to prevent validation errors:

- `Access::Action::"Activate"`
- `Access::Action::"Approve"`
- `Access::Action::"Close"`
- `Access::Action::"Extend"`

For example:

```diff
permit (
    principal,
    action == Access::Action::"Activate",
-   resource
+   resource is AWS::IDC::AccountGrant
);
```

The following actions may require you to specify an **Entitlement** resource type, such as `AWS::IDC::AccountEntitlement` to prevent validation errors:

- `Access::Action::"Request"`

For example:

```diff
permit (
    principal,
    action == Access::Action::"Request",
-   resource
+   resource is AWS::IDC::AccountEntitlement
);
```

These are described in more detail below.

### Activate, Close, and Approve actions on Grants

If you've come from an earlier version of Common Fate prior to the introduction of Cedar schemas, you may have Cedar policies similar referencing resource attributes similar to the below:

```cedar
permit (
    principal,
    action == Access::Action::"Activate",
    resource
)
when { resource.target.tags.contains({key:"department", value:"engineering"}) };
```

When validating this policy using `cf authz policyset validate`, you'll see an error similar to the below:

```
validating 1 policies
example.cedar ... FAILED

issues:

---- example.cedar ----

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type DataStax::Organization not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type Test::Vault not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type AWS::IDC::Group not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type Okta::Group not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type Entra::Group not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type GCP::Project not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type GCP::Folder not found
```

Cedar is complaining because the `Access::Action::"Activate"` action can be performed on Grants with different targets, such as AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Okta groups, but only AWS accounts have a `tags` attribute.

To fix this, we can specify the type of grant to be `AWS::IDC::AccountGrant` in the policy:

```diff
permit (
    principal,
    action == Access::Action::"Activate",
-   resource
+   resource is AWS::IDC::AccountGrant
)
when { resource.target.tags.contains({key:"department", value:"engineering"}) };
```

After changing the policy, `cf authz policyset validate` runs successfully:

```
validating 1 policies
example.cedar ... ok
```

The `AWS::IDC::AccountGrant` entity type represents [Grants](/setup/glossary#grant) to different target and role types. Here's a table with the various grant types:

| Resource Type (`resource`)    | Role (`resource.role`)    | Target (`resource.target`) |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `AWS::IDC::AccountGrant`      | `AWS::IDC::PermissionSet` | `AWS::Account`             |
| `GCP::ProjectGrant`           | `GCP::Role`               | `GCP::Project`             |
| `GCP::FolderGrant`            | `GCP::Role`               | `GCP::Folder`              |
| `DataStax::OrganizationGrant` | `DataStax::Role`          | `DataStax::Organization`   |
| `Okta::GroupGrant`            | `Okta::GroupRole`         | `Okta::Group`              |

<Note>
  We're constantly adding integrations to Common Fate, so the above table may
  not represent the authoritative list of grant types. If in doubt, you can
  reference the Cedar schema using `cf authz schema get`.
</Note>

### Request actions on Entitlements

Similar the the above, the below policy will fail validation:

```
permit (
    principal,
    action == Access::Action::"Request",
    resource
)
when { resource.target.tags.contains({key:"department", value:"engineering"}) };
```

When validating this policy using `cf authz policyset validate`, you'll see an error similar to the below:

```
validating 1 policies
example.cedar ... FAILED

issues:

---- example.cedar ----

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type DataStax::Organization not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type Test::Vault not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type AWS::IDC::Group not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type Okta::Group not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type Entra::Group not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type GCP::Project not found

	[ERROR] validation error on policy `policy0` at offset 88-158: attribute `tags` for entity type GCP::Folder not found
```

Cedar is complaining because the `Access::Action::"Request"` action can be performed on Entitlements with different targets, such as AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Okta groups, but only AWS accounts have a `tags` attribute.

To fix this, we can specify the type of entitlement to be `AWS::IDC::AccountEntitlement` in the policy:

```diff
permit (
    principal,
    action == Access::Action::"Request",
-   resource
+   resource is AWS::IDC::AccountEntitlement
)
when { resource.target.tags.contains({key:"department", value:"engineering"}) };
```

After changing the policy, `cf authz policyset validate` runs successfully:

```
validating 1 policies
example.cedar ... ok
```

The `AWS::IDC::AccountEntitlement` entity type represents [Entitlements](/setup/glossary#entitlement) to different target and role types. Here's a table with the various entitlement types:

| Resource Type (`resource`)          | Role (`resource.role`)    | Target (`resource.target`) |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `AWS::IDC::AccountEntitlement`      | `AWS::IDC::PermissionSet` | `AWS::Account`             |
| `GCP::ProjectEntitlement`           | `GCP::Role`               | `GCP::Project`             |
| `GCP::FolderEntitlement`            | `GCP::Role`               | `GCP::Folder`              |
| `DataStax::OrganizationEntitlement` | `DataStax::Role`          | `DataStax::Organization`   |
| `Okta::GroupEntitlement`            | `Okta::GroupRole`         | `Okta::Group`              |

<Note>
  We're constantly adding integrations to Common Fate, so the above table may
  not represent the authoritative list of entitlement types. If in doubt, you
  can reference the Cedar schema using `cf authz schema get`.
