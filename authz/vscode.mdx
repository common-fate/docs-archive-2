Common Fate uses [authorization policy-as-code](/authz/introduction) powered by [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/). To get immediate feedback and automatic code completion when you are writing Cedar policies, you can use the [Cedar extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cedar-policy.vscode-cedar) for [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Prerequisites

If you're running a BYOC ("Bring-Your-Own-Cloud") deployment of Common Fate in your own AWS account, you'll need to be on `v1.31.0` or later of the `common-fate/common-fate-deployment/aws` Terraform module.

You'll also need the [Common Fate `cf` CLI installed](/user-guide/cli/quickstart) - v1.12.0 or higher. You can check this by running `cf --version`. You should see an output similar to the below

```bash
cf --version
cf version v1.12.0
# version must be v1.12.0 or higher for this guide.
```

## Installing the VS Code extension

Install the extension by clicking the **Install** button on the [VS Code marketplace listing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cedar-policy.vscode-cedar).

Common Fate uses Cedar v3. Currently, Cedar v3 is supported in the _pre-release version_ of the Cedar extension.

After you've installed the extension, change to the pre-release version by navigating to the **Extensions** sidebar then choosing **Cedar** from the list of installed extensions. Click the **Switch to Pre-Release Version** button.

## Downloading the Cedar schema

To provide automatic code completion and live validation, the Cedar VS Code extension requires a Cedar schema file to be present in your workspace. This file must have the extension `.cedarschema.json`.

In the VS Code editor terminal, run the following command to download the schema and save it as `common-fate.cedarschema.json`:

```bash
cf authz schema get > common-fate.cedarschema.json
```

## Using the extension

After installing the extension, open the `common-fate-policy-testing` folder in VS Code. Try editing the policy. You will see live validation and automatic code completion similar to the below.
