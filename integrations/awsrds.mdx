Common Fate's [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) integration allows your end users to request Just-In-Time (JIT) access to RDS databases, leveraging AWS SSM to connect via the Common Fate AWS Proxy service deployed to ECS in your account.
The proxy service captures audit logs of all SQL commands executed by the user during their session which can be viewed in real-time.

This guide will walk you through integrating Common Fate with AWS RDS. By the end of this guide, you'll have a functioning integration with Common Fate with Databases available for access.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have [set up the Common Fate AWS integration](/integrations/aws) before adding AWS RDS. You'll also need to be using the [Common Fate Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/common-fate/commonfate/latest) v2.22+.

The AWS RDS integration creates temporary Permission Sets in IAM Identity Center allowing users to connect over AWS SSM Session Manager. In order to provision these Permission Sets, the Common Fate AWS integration IAM roles need some additional permissions.

To add these permissions using our Terraform module, ensure that the `permit_provision_permission_sets` variable is set to `true` in the Terraform module:

```diff
module "common-fate-aws-roles" {
  source                                = "common-fate/common-fate-deployment/aws//modules/aws-idc-integration/iam-roles"
  version                               = "2.0.0"
  common_fate_aws_account_id            = "123456789012"
  assume_role_external_id               = "your-external-id"
+ permit_provision_permission_sets      = true
}
```

## AWS RDS Overview

When a user requests access to a database in Common Fate, the provisioner creates a Permission Set in IAM Identity Center with the name set to the grant ID. This Permission Set is assigned to the user and the Account containing the Proxy.
The Permission Set grants the user access to connect to the proxy using SSM StartSession for the AWS-StartPortForwardingSession document only.

The user then uses the Granted CLI `granted rds proxy` to begin port-forwarding the database to their local machine.

## Audit Logging Queries

The Common Fate RDS Proxy handles MySQL and Postgres connections at the wire protocol level. The proxy acts as a database server to the database client, and forwards commands to the target database after logging the queries to the session logs in Common Fate for the Grant.

## Deploying the Proxy

The proxy module is deployed into the account containing the target RDS instances.

To deploy and register the proxy with Common Fate use our [commmon-fate-proxy-ecs](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/common-fate/common-fate-proxy-ecs/aws/latest) module which will handle deploying the ECS task and networking. Below is an example using the module.

To expose a database to Common Fate, you will need to register them with our [proxy-resource-aws-rds](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/common-fate/proxy-resource-aws-rds/commonfate/latest) Terraform module. Some examples have been provided below for configuring a mysql and postgres database.
The username field should match a user that exists in the database, you can consider creating a read only user in your database to limit the actions that can be taken while connected to the database.

<Tip>it is highly recommend to deploy the proxy and RDS modules in its own terraform root module. This avoids any dependency issues that may come up when making changes to your Common Fate deployment.</Tip>


```hcl
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      commonfate = {
        source  = "common-fate/commonfate"
        version = "~> 2.25"
      }
      aws = {
        source  = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = "~> 5.0"
      }
    }
  }

  provider "commonfate" {
    api_url            = "https://commonfate.example.com" // Your Common Fate App url
    oidc_client_id     = "<Your Provisioner OIDC client ID>"
    oidc_client_secret = "<Your Provisioner OIDC client secret>"
    oidc_issuer        = "<Your OIDC issuer>"
  }


 module "proxy" {
  source                     =  "common-fate/common-fate-proxy-ecs/aws"
  id                         = "<choose an id>"
  common_fate_aws_account_id = "12345678912" // the account where Common Fate is deployed
  subnet_ids                 = [] // the proxy must be on a subnet with outbound internet access for AWS SSM to connect
  vpc_id                     = "" // the VPC to deploy into
  ecs_cluster_id             = "" // the ECS Cluster to deploy into
  ecs_cluster_name           = "" // the ECS Cluster name
  auth_issuer                = module.common-fate-deployment.outputs.auth_issuer // fetch this from your Common Fate deployment

  proxy_service_client_id    = "<Your Provisioner OIDC client ID>"
  proxy_service_client_secret= "<Your Provisioner OIDC client secret>"

  app_url = "https://commonfate.example.com" // Your Common Fate App url

}


module "database" {
  source                  = "common-fate/proxy-resource-aws-rds/commonfate"
  proxy_id                = module.proxy.proxy_id
  rds_instance_identifier = "example"
  name                    = "Prod Postgres Database"
  app_url                 = "https://commonfate.example.com" // Your Common Fate App url
  database                = "postgres" // The name of the database on the RDS instance
  rds_security_group_id   = "sg-12345678912" // database security group id
  region                  = "us-west-2"

  users = [{
     name                         = "Root"
     username                     = "postgres"
     password_secrets_manager_arn = "<The ARN of the Secrets Manager secret for this database user>"
  }]
 }

```

The common-fate/proxy-resource-aws-rds/commonfate module creates the necessary IAM policies to allow the proxy service to read the database secrets from Secrets Manager. This module also creates a security group rule allowing the proxy to access the database.
The AWS Secrets Manager secret value referenced by `password_secrets_manager_arn` **must** be a key/value pair containing a `password` key. For example, the following secret in JSON format is valid:

```json
{ "username": "postgres", "password": "postgrespassword" }
```

Secrets managed by AWS RDS follow this format automatically.

## Configuring Common Fate

In this section, you will add selectors and availabilities so that users can request access to the databases. You'll need to have [set up the Common Fate Application Configuration repository using our Terraform provider](/config/terraform).

You can create an access workflow, or use an existing one. 
```hcl
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "rds" {
  name                     = "RDS"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60
  priority                 = 1
}
```

Now create a commonfate_aws_rds_database_availability. This resources make a single database and user available to request:

```hcl
resource "commonfate_aws_rds_database_availability" "postgres_root" {
  workflow_id                  = commonfate_access_workflow.rds.id
  // you can find the database id in the Common Fate console on the resources page
  aws_rds_database_id          = "arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:12345678912:db:example/postgres"
  // you can find the user id in the Common Fate console on the resources page or in the children tab of the database resource
  aws_rds_database_user_id     = "postgres@arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:12345678912:db:example/postgres"
  aws_identity_store_id        = local.identity_store_id
}
```

## Connecting to a Database

Users connect to a database using Granted CLI.

### Select a database

<Note>
  Some database requests may require approval, you can use the `--wait` flag and
  the CLI will wait for your request to be approved, then start the proxy.
</Note>

```

❯ granted rds proxy
Select a database to connect to
Database Role

> Demo MySQL Database Root

    Demo Postgres Database                  Read Only
    Demo Postgres Database                  Root

```

### Connect your database client

The CLI will provide the connection information, these are stable between grants for the same database and role.

<Note>
  If you need to run the portforward on an different port, use the flag
  `--port=1234`
</Note>

```

[i] Database proxy ready for connections on 127.0.0.1:5432

[i] You can connect now using this connection string: postgresql://read_only:password@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable

[i] Or using the postgres cli: psql "postgresql://read_only:password@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"

```

## Updating the Proxy

When you update your Proxy deployment in ECS, a container restart may be required. In this case, all active connections to the database will be terminated.
