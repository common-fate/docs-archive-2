  later.

This guide will walk you through integrating Common Fate with Auth0. By the end of this guide, you'll have a functioning integration with Common Fate, allowing it to provision access to Auth0 Organizations.

## Auth0 Setup

To configure the Auth0 integration, create a Machine-To-Machine application in the Auth0 administrative console.

In the Auth0 administrative console, browse to **Applications**.

<img src="/images/auth0/setup-1.png" />

Name the application **Common Fate**. Choose **Machine to Machine Applications** as the application type.

<img src="/images/auth0/setup-2.png" />

Click on the newly created application. Take a note of the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** attributes, as you will need them in the next steps.

<img src="/images/auth0/setup-3.png" />

You will need to create a new `SecretString` in SSM Parameter Store and then use the path when configuring your deployment in Terraform.

You can use the AWS CLI to create a secret in the region you are deploying to. We recommend naming these `"/<namespace>/<stage>/<secret name>"`.

```bash
# run this in the AWS account and region that Common Fate is deployed to
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/common-fate/prod/auth0-client-secret" \
    --value "<client secret from the above step>" \
    --type "SecureString"
```

## Configuring Common Fate

In this section, you will register the Auth0 integration with your Common Fate deployment. At the end of this section you should have Common Fate ready to provision access. You'll need to have [set up the Common Fate Application Configuration repository using our Terraform provider](/config/terraform).

Inside your Application Configuration repository, add the following module:

```hcl
resource "commonfate_auth0_integration" "auth0" {
  name                      = "Auth0"
  domain                    = "<your domain from above, e.g. dev-1ulors88vi7zjge6.us.auth0.com>"
  client_id                 = "<your Client ID from above, e.g. ISQp0GiY0xcdODDdWRFnuh5Ypfm0XIa1>"
  client_secret_secret_path = "/common-fate/prod/auth0-client-secret"
}
```

Apply the changes. If the apply succeeds, you should see the integration appear on the settings page in the web dashboard.

## Provisioning access to Auth0 Organizations

To grant and revoke access to Auth0 Organizations, Common Fate uses a service called the Provisioner. The Provisioner is an internal service and is not user-facing.
In default deployments, there is a provisioner builtin to the main stack which can be configured using blocks.

To configure the builtin Provisioner for Auth0 Organizations, add the `provisioner_okta_config` config block as per the example below:

```hcl
module "common-fate-deployment" {
  source = "common-fate/common-fate-deployment/aws"
  version = "..."

  provisioner_auth0_config = {
    domain                    = "<your domain from above, e.g. dev-1ulors88vi7zjge6.us.auth0.com>"
    client_id                 = "<your Client ID from above, e.g. ISQp0GiY0xcdODDdWRFnuh5Ypfm0XIa1>"
    client_secret_secret_path = "/common-fate/prod/auth0-client-secret"
  }
}
```

You can now create an access workflow and availabilities:

```hcl
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "auth0" {
  name                     = "auth0"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60 * 2
  priority                 = 1
}

resource "commonfate_auth0_organization_selector" "select_all" {
  id              = "example"
  name            = "Example"
  auth0_tenant_id = "<your Auth0 domain, e.g. dev-1ulors88vi7zjge6.us.auth0.com>"
  when            = "true"
}


resource "commonfate_auth0_organization_availabilities" "demo" {
  workflow_id             = commonfate_access_workflow.auth0.id
  okta_group_selector_id = commonfate_auth0_organization_selector.select_all.id
  auth0_tenant_id = "<your Auth0 domain, e.g. dev-1ulors88vi7zjge6.us.auth0.com>"
}
```
