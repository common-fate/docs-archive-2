Common Fate can send webhook events based on audit log and authorization events to a HTTP destination. You can use webhook events to build your own alerts or integrations with Common Fate, or to push events to a monitoring platform.

## Prerequisites

To configure a webhook integration you'll need to use version 2.14 or later of our [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/common-fate/commonfate/latest).

If you're running a BYOC ("Bring-Your-Own-Cloud") deployment of Common Fate in your own AWS account, you'll need to be on `v1.36.0` or later of the `common-fate/common-fate-deployment/aws` Terraform module.

## Setting up

You can configure a webhook by adding a Terraform resource similar to the below:

```hcl
resource "commonfate_webhook_integration" "my_webhook_destination" {
  name                      = "My Webhook Destination"
  url                       = "https://webhook.example.com/webhook/path"
  send_audit_log_events     = true
  send_authorization_events = true
  headers = [
    {
      key   = "My-Custom-Header",
      value = "abcdef123"
    },
      {
      key   = "X-my_other_header",
      value = "def456"
    }
  ]
}
```

Common Fate can send Audit Log events and/or Authorization events to a webhook.

| Event Type    | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Audit Log     | Emitted when a Grant to an entitlement is updated                                                                       |
| Authorization | Emitted when an authorization decision is made. Authorization events are emitted each time a Common Fate API is called. |

You can set HTTP headers by specifying them in the `headers` variable.

Common Fate will make a `POST` request to the specified HTTP endpoint each time a matching event occurs.

## Audit Log actions

Audit log events contain an `action` field indicating the particular action which occurred in Common Fate:

| Action                         | Emitted when                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `grant.extended`               | Access was extended.                                                                                          |
| `grant.deprovisioned`          | Access was deprovisioned in the integration.                                                                  |
| `grant.cancelled`              | Pending access was cancelled                                                                                  |
| `grant.revoked`                | Active access was revoked                                                                                     |
| `grant.provisioning_error`     | Common Fate encountered an error when provisioning access.                                                    |
| `grant.deprovisioning_error`   | Common Fate encountered an error when deprovisioning access.                                                  |
| `grant.breakglass_activated`   | Access was activated using breakglass access.                                                                 |

  "index": 0
}
```

The `index` field is currently used internally for sorting audit logs emitted concurrently.

The `caller_identity_chain` includes the specific OIDC token and subject used by the caller to authenticate to Common Fate.

The `targets` field includes resources which are affected by the action.

The `context.request.client_addr` field contains the IP address of the actor that performed the action.

The `context.authz.eval` field contains the authorization evaluation associated with a particular action. You can [inspect the authorization event](/observability/authorization) in Common Fate.
