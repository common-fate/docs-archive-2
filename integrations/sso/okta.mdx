### Create the SAML Application

To get started navigate to the **Applications** tab of the Okta console.

Click **Create App Integration**, then select the **SAML 2.0** option. Click **Next** then Give your application a suitable name then click **Next**.

### Configure the SAML Application

Set the **Single sign-on URL** field to be `first_time_setup_config.saml_sso_acs_url` from the deployment outputs.

Set the **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** field to be `first_time_setup_config.saml_sso_entity_id` from the deployment outputs.

In Attributes Statements set **Name** to `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` and **Value** to `user.email`.

Click **Next** then **Finish**

<Note>
  You'll need to assign yourself and other users to the SAML application before
  you can login.
</Note>

### Setup the SAML SSO provider in your deployment

Copy the **Metadata URL** from the **Sign On** tab of your newly created application.

Add the following variables to your Terraform deployment

```toml
saml_provider_name    = "Okta"
saml_metadata_is_file = false
saml_metadata_source  = <The SAML metadata URL>
```

Now, run a deployment:

```bash
terraform apply
```
