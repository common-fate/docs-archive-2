## Changing the web browser

To see which browser Granted will use to open cloud consoles with, run `granted browser`.

To change the web browser, run the command:

```
granted browser set
```

You will get a response like this:

```
? Select your default browser  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Chrome
  Brave
  Edge
  Firefox
  Chromium
  Safari
  Firefox Developer Edition
  Arc
```

Select which browser you would like to use and press Enter.

## Using specific browser profiles

Launching a specific browser profile is possible with `--browser-profile` flag for supported browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Chromium Variants. Example usage: `assume profile-name -c --browser-profile "<your_browser_profile>"`

## Setting a custom browser template
If you use browsers that we do not provide built-in support for in Granted, or wish to customise the behaviour of browser launching, there are custom templates that can be set for the console browser and for SSO authentication browser. If set these templates will be used as a first priority.

### Custom Template for Console Browser
```
# ~/.granted/config
[AWSConsoleBrowserLaunchTemplate]
  Command = "/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox --new-tab {{.URL}} --profile {{.Profile}} --some-flag {{.Args.Foo}}"
  UseForkProcess = true
```

### Custom Template for SSO Authentication
Example: Opening chrome into a specified profile
<Info>
To find the name of your chrome profile. First open chrome in your profile of choice and search `chrome://version/` and you should see the profile path:

Profile Path: /Users/your-path/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 2
So "Profile 2" is the profile to set in the below command for --profile-directory
</Info>
```
# ~/.granted/config
[SSOBrowserLaunchTemplate]
  Command = "\"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\" {{ .URL }} --args \"--profile-directory=Profile 2\""
```

## Setting color and icon preferences for profiles

If you use Firefox with the [Granted Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/granted/), you can set the color and icon preference for each profile. This is useful for distinguishing between profiles at a glance.

To customize the color and icon add `granted_color` and `granted_icon` to the profile in your `~/.aws/config` file.

This configuration:

```
granted_color = green
granted_icon = dollar
```

Will result in this:

<img height="200" src="/images/granted/granted-firefox-custom-color-icon.png" />

Valid colors are: `blue`, `turquoise`, `green`, `yellow`, `orange`, `red`, `pink` and `purple`

Valid icons are: `fingerprint`, `briefcase`, `dollar`, `cart`, `circle`, `gift`, `vacation`, `food`, `fruit`, `pet`, `tree` and `chill`

## Custom browser for running SSO flows

You can specify a custom browser path for your SSO login flows with Granted.

```
granted browser set-sso
```

You will get a response like this:

```
ℹ️  Select your SSO default browser

? Select your default browser Chrome

✅  Granted will default to using /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome for SSO flows.
```
