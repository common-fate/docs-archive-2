## Changing the profile ordering

There are settings options in Granted which allow you to change the way that profiles are listed in use. Default being by Frecency. Alternatively it can be configured to list profiles alphabetically. To set the profile ordering type just run:

```
granted settings profile-order set
```

From here you will be able to select your preferred method of choice

```
? Select filter type  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Frecency
  Alphabetical
```

### Frecency

Granted uses a [Frecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency) algorithm to show the most frequent and recent profiles at the top of the list when running `assume`. The algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/common-fate/granted/blob/main/pkg/frecency/frecency.go). The algorithm caches frecency data locally in the `aws_profiles_frecency` file in the Granted configuration folder.
