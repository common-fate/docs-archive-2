## Error reporting and update checking

We currently do not collect error reports in Granted but this is something we are considering in future in order to ensure Granted works reliably on all platforms. Any error reporting telemetry, including instructions on how to opt out, will be communicated through GitHub and this documentation page.

The Granted binary will periodically check to see if new versions are available by calling https://update.api.granted.dev.

To disable update checking you can set the environment variable `GRANTED_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=true`.
