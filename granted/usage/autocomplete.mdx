## Autocompletion

Granted has support for shell auto complete. We currently support zsh and fish, with plans to support [bash, and powershell](https://github.com/urfave/cli/tree/master/autocomplete) in the future. Please let us know of your interest by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/common-fate/granted/issues).

### Fish

Fish autocompletions can be created by running the following command, then following the prompts.

Note that this currently only provides command and flag autocompletion; it does not automatically list AWS profiles with the assume command.
Let us know if you are using Fish and would like to see this added.

```
granted completion -s fish
```

### ZSH

ZSH autocompletion can be enabled by running the following command.

```
granted completion -s zsh
```

Type `assume` and press **tab** to see a list of your aws profiles.

```
assume
profile-1 profile-2 profile-3
```

Type `assume -` and press **tab** to see flag completions.

```
