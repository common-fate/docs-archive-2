## Granted Configuration Folder

The configuration settings for Granted are stored within the `$HOME/.granted` folder on Unix systems, and `%USERPROFILE%/.granted` on Windows. This designated folder serves as a repository for configuration data, encompassing:

- **Default Browser Configuration**: The `DefaultBrowser` option allows you to [establish the default browser](#changing-the-web-browser).

- **Custom Browser Paths**: The `CustomBrowserPath` option lets you override default installation paths for browsers with custom locations.

- **Custom Single Sign-On (SSO) Browser Paths**: The `CustomSSOBrowserPath` option provides the ability to [set custom browser](#custom-browser-for-running-sso-flows) for running Single Sign-On (SSO) flows.

- **Profile Ordering**: The `Ordering` option allows you to change the [order of profiles](#changing-the-profile-ordering) when they are displayed.

- **Export Credential Suffix**: The `ExportCredentialSuffix` option enables appending a suffix when exporting credentials.

- **Access Request URL**: The `AccessRequestURL` option lets you set a Glide URL that can be used to request access.

- **CommonFate SSO Default Start URL and Region**: The `CommonFateDefaultSSOStartURL` and `CommonFateDefaultSSORegion` options respectively set the default start URL and region for CommonFate Single Sign-On.

- **Usage Tips and Credential Caching**: The `DisableUsageTips` option, when set to true, suppresses usage tips. The `DisableCredentialProcessCache` option, when set to true, prevents credential caching via credential processes.

- **Export All Environment Variables**: The `DefaultExportAllEnvVar=true` configuration exports all environment variables by default when the `credential_process` is used.

- **Export Credentials To AWS**: The `ExportCredsToAWS=true` configuration will enable credentials to be exported to `~/.aws/credentials` by default.

To configure any of these options, you can use the following command:

```
granted settings set
```

## Granted Configuration Editing

Granted gives you tools to be able to interact with the config that is set under the hood.

- Use the `-unset` flag to remove any exported environment variables that Granted has provisioned
  eg.

```
assume -unset
```

- Use the `uninstall` command to reset the granted configuration to a factory default

```
granted uninstall
```


## Customize AWS Configuration and Credentials File Locations

Specify the location of your AWS configuration file and credentials file through environment variables. Set the `$AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and `$AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variables to configure these file locations according to your preferences.
