# Troubleshooting

## Manually configuring your shell profile

If you keep your shell profile in a non-standard location, Granted may fail to install the alias. If this happens, you can manually add the alias to your shell profile. Some examples are included below to assist you:

### Bash

Add the following to `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
alias assume="source assume"
```

### ZSH

Add the following to `~/.zshenv`:

```bash
alias assume="source assume"
```

### Fish

Add the following to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```bash
alias assume="source /usr/local/bin/assume.fish"
```

<Note>

After adding the alias to your shell profile manually, if Granted does not detect that the alias is configured, please run `export GRANTED_ALIAS_CONFIGURED="true"` before running `assume` to bypass the setup process.

</Note>

## AWS SSO issues

### Regions

Entering the wrong `sso_region` will result in this cryptic looking error:

If you don't know which SSO region your AWS organization is in, you'll need to check with whoever set up your AWS SSO service. Alternatively, you can just guess until you get it right. There's only [twenty-one](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sso.html) of them.

## Where does Granted store its settings?

Granted settings are in `~/.granted`. If your trying to find where a setting is coming from, also check these directories:

* `~/.aws`
* `~/.password-store`
* `~/.gnupg`
* `~/.local/share/keyrings`

## gpg: decryption failed: no secret key

If you are tyring to use `pass`, [make sure you followed the instructions](./recipes/pass.md). Note that `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` must have been executed in the current shell so that you can be asked for your password.

## Granted stopped working (Windows)

On Windows in WSL2, Granted can sometimes stop working completely. The solution is to reboot.
