## Granted Configuration Editing

Granted gives you tools to be able to interact with the config that is set under the hood.

- Use the `-unset` flag to remove any exported environment variables that Granted has provisioned
  eg.

```
assume -unset
```

- Use the `uninstall` command to reset the granted configuration to a factory default

```
granted uninstall
```


## Customize AWS Configuration and Credentials File Locations

Specify the location of your AWS configuration file and credentials file through environment variables. Set the `$AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and `$AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variables to configure these file locations according to your preferences.
