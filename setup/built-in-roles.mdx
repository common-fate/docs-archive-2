Some features and actions in your Common Fate deployment can only be accessed by a user who has been assigned to the administrator role.
The administrator role is referred to as a built-in role, and it can be accessed using a JIT assignment in the same way that users request access to other entitlements.
On new deployments, the built-in roles are ready for use by default to help you get started.

## Built-in roles

| name         | ID                        | access |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------ |
| Administrator | CF::Role::"administrator" | Manage policies, read deployment secrets, create integrations    |

## Make the Administrator role available for request

The simplest way you make the role available to request is to add the following Cedar policy:

```js
permit (
    principal is CF::User,
    action == Access::Action::"Request",
    resource is CF::DeploymentEntitlement
);

permit (
    principal is CF::User,
    action == Access::Action::"Activate",
    resource is CF::DeploymentGrant
);

permit (
    principal is CF::User,
    action == Access::Action::"Close",
    resource is CF::DeploymentGrant
);
```

Users will be able to request access for up to 24 hours by creating a request in the console for the role CF::Role::"administrator" to target CF::Deployment::"common-fate".

## Restricting access to a specific built-in role

You can restrict access to a specific built-in role by adding a `when` clause to your Cedar policy:

```js
permit (
    principal is CF::User,
    action == Access::Action::"Request",
    resource is CF::DeploymentEntitlement
) when {resource.role == CF::Role::"administrator"};

permit (
    principal is CF::User,
    action == Access::Action::"Activate",
    resource is CF::DeploymentGrant
) when {resource.role == CF::Role::"administrator"};

permit (
    principal is CF::User,
    action == Access::Action::"Close",
    resource is CF::DeploymentGrant
);
```

## Add slack notifications or restrict the request duration

If you would like to add slack alerts, you can either attach an alert config to the built-in workflow `wrk_builtin_default` or create your own workflow and an availability spec:
When you use your own workflow, set the priority to 1 or higher.

```hcl
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "builtin_roles" {
  name                     = "built-in roles"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60 # 1 hour
  priority                 = 1
}


resource "commonfate_availability_spec" "builtin_administrator_role" {
  workflow_id = commonfate_access_workflow.builtin_roles.id
  role = {
    type = "CF::Role"
    id   = "administrator"
  }

  target = {
    type = "CF::Deployment"
    id   = "common-fate"
  }
}
```
