### Error: CNAMEAlreadyExists

If you encounter the following error when deploying `main.tf`:

```
Error: creating Cognito User Pool Domain:
InvalidParameterException: One or more of the CNAMEs you provided are already associated with a different resource.
(Service: AmazonCloudFront; Status Code: 409; Error Code: CNAMEAlreadyExists; Request ID: f7546b6a-b6fe-47e0-9c60-ec313aa6d54c; Proxy: null)
```

#### Fix

This error is caused mostly because your Auth domain (e.g., auth.commonfate.example.com) has an existing A record. Remove the record and then rerun `terraform apply`.
